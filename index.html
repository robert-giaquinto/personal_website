  <h3>About me.</h3>

  <p>I'm a master's student in the Computer Science department at the University of Minnesota. Prior to graduate school I had the pleasure of working under Dr. Alex Ushveridze on Capella Education Company's predictive modeling team. I attended <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/">St. Olaf College</a> where I studied mathematics and statistics, conducted <a href="http://wp.stolaf.edu/cir/">research</a> on alumni giving, and met my future <a href="http://mnbride.com/real-weddings/lindsey-robert-spring-wedding-minnesota-boat-club">wife</a> Lindsey.</p>

  <h3>Research interests.</h3>

  <p>While my master's coursework has included a breadth of topics, my primary research interests are in machine learning, artificial intelligence, and natural language processing. More specifically, I'm interested in building agents with the ability to understand commands given by natural language. Additionally, I 'm interested in developing multi-agent systems that can learn and explore their environment autonomously through reinforcement learning.</p>
